Shift from AidStream Lite to Core
Hi.
My organisation has been created in AidStream for the Lite version - but I need to change to the Core version. I am not given the option in my LogIn to change between these Lite and Core. Can anyone please help me?
Or do I have to create another profile for the Organization - which will probably create a number of problems in terms of identification number etc... ?
I appreaciate any help.
